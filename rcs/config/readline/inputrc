set meta-flag on
set input-meta on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "builtin cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "builtin cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on

# Use color to indicate file type for completed files
set colored-stats on

set colored-completion-prefix on

# Allow TAB to cycle through complete options
