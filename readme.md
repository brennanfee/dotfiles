# My dotfiles

My personal and work [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) for Mac, Linux, and Windows (WSL).

${toc}

## Overview

I use the [RCM](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) from Thoughtbot to manage my dotfiles. This tool
is usable on Linux, Mac, and now Windows using the
[Windows Subsystem For Linux (WSL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about).

If you haven't already read about RCM I highly encourage you to read and understand it before
attempting to understand how these files are structured here. An overview article on RCM can be
found [here](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/rcm-for-rc-files-in-dotfiles-repos).

## Setting up a machine

**Prerequisites: RCM and CURL.**

To set up or reinstall a machine to use the dotfiles you must first install RCM and curl. At this
point you should also install any needed SSH keys to perform the following clone. Once configured,
clone this repo into the ~/.dotfiles-rc directory and follow the steps below.

1. Execute ~/.dotfiles-rc/setup.bash
1. Edit ~/.rcrc as needed for the machine you are on. Tags may need to be changed, etc.
1. Then run `rcup`

It's common to have to restart your shell after running `rcup`.

## dotfiles-private

Given that this repo is intended to be public it prohibits placing anything "sensitive" into the
repository. Due to that, everything has been pre-configured to support a second dotfiles repository
placed into ~/.dotfiles-private. Within that an rcs folder can be used to contain overrides and
extensions to the dotfiles placed here.

NOTE: The `mkrc` command won't work in this case because the rcs will always go into the public
repository when executing `mkrc`. Any files needed to be in the private repository will need to be
placed there manually.

## OS and local override files

Some dotfiles support "include" files as a way of organizing extensions. The files that do support
such a construct have been pre-configured to allow both an OS specific override as well as a local
(host specific) override. In all cases the order is: first the global settings, then the OS
settings, lastly the local settings. Any files\settings in dotfiles can further be overridden using
the dotfiles-private repository.

## Windows, WSL, and PowerShell

For Windows machines the above steps should all be performed in the bash shell provided by WSL.
After these steps you could then pull the [WinFiles](https://github.com/brennanfee/winfiles) repo to
set up PowerShell and the Windows system (see that repo for instructions).
